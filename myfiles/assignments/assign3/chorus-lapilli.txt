starting from where we left off in tic-tac-toe...
first thing we need to do is implement the rules in handleClick
because everything is the same otherwise.
a few things are different in handleClick:
  - 4th piece isnt allowed
    - need to move 3rd piece 
      - need to be able to select a piece
      - and then move it
        - need a check for adjacency
    - check if piece in center exists
      - if it does force moving that one

how to do 4th piece:
  - if move # for X >=6
  - if move # for O >=7

how to move the piece for X's turn:
  - force selection of an X, turn it to blank
  - next move, 2nd move aka. force selection of 
    blank square with adjacency to original i
  - need to store the previous i. always
  - if previous i was blank, then we are on move 2/2
  - if select same square aka i == previ, then its an undo move
    aka put the X back, and then have it still be X's turn
  - otherwise change turns again
  - if center X exists, force movement of that piece to an empty one
    - unless there is a winning move. 
    - maybe first let the person click once, and if he can't find
      a winning move, then just reject moves until he undos

  - double click still works even though that piece is the only
    option

Notes:

changing turns: xIsNext: !this.state.xIsNext
element of board: squares[i] where i: 0-8
