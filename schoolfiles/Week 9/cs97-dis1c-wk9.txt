ASSIGNMENT 6 (contd...)
-----------------------

  - due week 10 (Monday, 7th Dec)
  - https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall20/cs97-1/assign/assign6.html
    - https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall20/cs97-1/assign.html
  - Git repository organization (git internals)
    - commits
      - commit aliases
        - refs/HEAD
        - refs/heads/master
        - refs/heads/*
      - commit objects
        - objects/dd/9515b11ebcab015a8a91b494097d06827df5a5    <-- zlib compressed data
        - objects/<1st-2-digits>/<remaining-38-digits>
  - development environment
    - git, python3  <-- that's it
      - NO SEASnet / lnxsrv09 restriction this time!
    - I'll once again recommend https://repl.it
      - https://repl.it/l/python3
  - tasks : find .git directory; list branches; build commit DAG; print commit DAG (topological order)
  - extremely helpful test suite
    - https://github.com/Rustinante/topo-ordered-commits-test-suite
    - contains a nice set of test repositories
    - easy to setup and explore

  - recall python3 mechanics
    ------------------------
    - structure    : functions / classes / scripts / modules / packages    (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
    - data types   : strings, tuples, lists, dicts, sets    (https://docs.python.org/3/library/datatypes.html)
    - control flow : if/else, loops, iterables    (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html)
    - built-ins / standard library    (https://docs.python.org/3/library/)
      - len(), filter(), map(), sorted()
      - import os, sys, zlib

  - task 1
    ------
    - finding .git directory
      - similar to how all "git ..." commands first find .git directory
      - by looking for .git in the current directory, fallback to parent directory, so on...
      - discovery process should only go up, and never descend into a child directory
      - can keep going till / (root directory)
      - failure -> output ‘Not inside a Git repository’ to standard error and exit with status 1
    - relevant python3
      - import os       : https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html
      - import sys      : https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html
      - os.getcwd()     : https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getcwd
      - os.path.isdir() : https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.isdir
      - print()         : https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print
      - sys.stderr      : https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/sys.html#sys.stderr
      - sys.exit()      : https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/sys.html#sys.exit

  - task 2
    ------
    - read important git internal references
      - Git Objects    : https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects
      - Git References : https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References
    - listing branches
      - branches map to refs/heads/**/*
      - special case: branches with / in their name
        - release/v1.2.3  <-- refs/heads/release/v1.2.3
        - release/v1.3.5  <-- refs/heads/release/v1.3.5
        - dev/feat-xyz    <-- refs/heads/dev/feat-xyz
    - relevant python3
      - os.listdir()        : https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir
      - os.walk()           : https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk
      - os.DisEntry         : https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.DirEntry
      - os.DirEntry.is_dir  : https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.DirEntry.is_dir
      - os.DirEntry.is_file : https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.DirEntry.is_file

  - task 3
    ------
    - building commit DAG
      - recall commits are the building blocks of a git repository
        - each commit
          - id : sha1 hash hex digest <-- length 40
          - parent
          - title, message, author, timestamp, etc
        - commits map to objects/[0-f]{2}/[0-f]{38}  <-- zlib compressed data files
      - relevant python3
        - zlib                : https://docs.python.org/3/library/zlib.html
        - reading git objects : https://matthew-brett.github.io/curious-git/reading_git_objects.html
      - data structure for commit object
          class CommitNode:
            def __init__(self, commit_hash):
              """
              :type commit_hash: str
              """
              self.commit_hash = commit_hash
              self.parents = set()
              self.children = set()
      - data structure for commit DAG
        - _________   <-- fill blank
      - algo for building the commit DAG
        - for each branch
          - starting from the branch head; perform depth first search traversal
            - first read branch head commit object
            - then read parent commit object (if multiple parents, depth first semantics)
            - establish parent child relationship
            - leaf node reached when there's no further parent (a.k.a root_commit)

  - task 4
    ------

    - topological ordering of the commit DAG
      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting
      - important and ubiqutious ordering for directed graphs, particularly DAGs
      - keeps directional relationships intact; not a single violation allowed
      - ALWAYS exists at least one such ordering for DAGs
      - more than one can exist
      - e.g. c0 -> c1 -> c2 (branch-1)
                    \
                      -> c3 -> c4 (branch-2, branch-5)
                            \
                              -> c5 (branch-3)

        - (c5, c4, c3, c2, c1, c0)    <-- parents always come after their children
        - (c2, c5, c4, c3, c1, c0)    <-- parents always come after their children

  - task 5
    ------

    - (one column) printing topological sort
      - use commit ids / hash digest
      - "=" for "sticky ends"
    - (c5, c4, c3, c2, c1, c0)

      h5 branch-3
      h4 branch-2 branch-5
      h3
      h1=
                        <-- "sticky ends" will have blanks                   c0 -> c1 -> c2 (branch-1)
      =                                                                              \
      h2 branch-1                                                                     -> c3 -> c4 (branch-2, branch-5)
      h1                                                                                      \
      h0                                                                                       -> c5 (branch-3)


    - (c2, c5, c4, c3, c1, c0)

      h2 branch-1
      h1=
                        <-- "sticky ends" will have blanks
      =
      h5 branch-3
      h4 branch-2 branch-5
      h3
      h1
      h0
