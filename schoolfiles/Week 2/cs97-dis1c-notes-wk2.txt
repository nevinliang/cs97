ANNOUNCEMENTS
    - assignment 2 is out
        - emacs lisp and python

EMACS LISP
    - high level scripting; application scripting
    - dynamic and interpreted
    - one of several lisp flavors / implementations
    - looks and feels weird because of behind-the-scene simplicity
    - parenthesis heavy; important to keep them balanced and indented
    - functions are the bread and butter
        - call functions, pass functions, define new functions
    - lists are another bread and butter
    - variables, values, symbols
    - strings, numbers, boolean, nil
    - let and set constructs
    - local and global variables
    - stuff relevant to assignment 2
        - what-line
        - count-lines
        - point-min
        - point-max
    - simple conditionals, like if-then-else
    - expressions, like arithmetic
  
PYTHON
    - highly versatile and ubiquitous
        - alternative to shell scripting for system/os commands
        - data science, machine learning
        - web: applications, servers
    - most common implementation written in C
        - but also implemented in java, python (itself)
    - python repl
        - has decent documentation for most built-ins
    - variables, values
    - data types
        - numbers, strings
        - lists, tuples, dictionaries
        - functions, methods
        - classes
        - modules, packages
    - loops, iterations
    - os module
        - interacting with the environment
            - path, etc
        - interacting with the file system
            - list files, directories
    - sys module
        - argc, argv
        - stdin, stdout, stderr
    - argparse module
        - for easily implementing conventional cli argument parsing
            - options (short name, long name)
                - value
                - switches
            - positional
                - simple standard arguments
        - typically used like
            - initialize
            - configure
            - parse
    - random module
        - choice()
        - shuffle()
        - sample()
